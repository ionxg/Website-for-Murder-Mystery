        description: `The Ung-chonlamark family is of Thai-Chinese descent. The family patriarch, 黄海强, Ung Hái Kióng (in Teochew) or Huáng Hǎi Qiáng (in Mandarin), immigrated from Shantou to Bangkok, where he settled down. His son, Samut, founded a construction business called Ung Construction, which was later renamed CLM Property. However, Samut's business faced numerous problems and was on the brink of bankruptcy.
                    While CLM Property was struggling, Samut's two sons, Natee and Tara, were still in school. They stepped in to help manage the business and successfully revitalised it, growing CLM Property into the fifth-largest real estate company in Southeast Asia. Samut later founded an additional business, CLM Yacht Club, which led to the establishment of CLM Group. Earlier this year, Natee opened the Natee & Tara Theatre, the largest theatre in Southeast Asia. It currently features three stage productions: The Lion King, Death Note, and What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?`

          <p>Over the past three years, three members of the Ung-chonlamark family have died in a continuous chain of events.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tara</strong>, the youngest son of Samut, died three years ago at the age of 23. He was killed in a car accident. Police believe his car was speeding on a wet, slippery road, causing him to lose control and crash through a bridge barrier, falling into the river.</li>
            <li><strong>Samut</strong>, the father of Waree, Natee, and Tara, died in his bedroom two years ago at the age of 51 while with his third and most recent wife. The hospital determined the cause of death was a heart attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Natee</strong>, the eldest son of Samut, was murdered last night. His body was found in his ransacked office. Several valuables were missing, and numerous fingerprints were found at the scene. His body was discovered by Sumin, a housemaid, and Hoang, a friend of Sumin. Based on the investigation, Natee's time of death is estimated to be between 8–10 PM. The murder weapon was a kitchen knife. Signs of a struggle were also found in his office.</li>

        description: `A Thai man of Chinese descent and the former CEO of the CLM Group. In his youth, he lived in Thailand with his father, a Chinese immigrant. As a teenager, he went to Vietnam to seek his fortune, where he had a daughter, Waree, with a Vietnamese woman. After his Vietnamese wife's death from an unspecified cause, he returned to Thailand with his daughter and founded Ung Construction, which was later renamed CLM Property.
He remarried a Thai woman of Chinese descent, and they had two sons, Natee and Tara. After his second wife passed away from an illness, Samut caused a public scandal by marrying Jenny, who was the fiancée of the Ung-chonlamark family's lawyer and head of the CLM Group's legal department.
Samut’s poor management of CLM Property nearly drove the company to bankruptcy. Fortunately, his two sons, who were still in university at the time, stepped in to help manage and successfully rescue the company. This significantly diminished Samut's influence. Not long after, he died in his bedroom while with Jenny, with the autopsy report listing the cause of death as a heart attack.
Samut is remembered more for his negative traits than his positive ones. He was a notorious womaniser and was accused of sexually harassing several female employees. He was known for his drunken rages and abusing his power, a stark contrast to his sons, Natee and Tara, who are both respectful of their employees and well-mannered.

        description: `Natee's half-sister. Born and raised in Vietnam, she later moved to Thailand and cannot speak English. She has a history of alcohol and substance abuse and is in significant debt. However, she has reportedly been undergoing treatment for her addictions. Waree has been married twice. Her first marriage was to an English boyfriend from her school days. After their divorce, he was stabbed to death by a drug dealer in France. Her second marriage was to a Hong Kong businessman, which also ended in divorce.
Currently, Waree is unemployed and living in Natee's house. Police records show that two years ago, she attempted to stab Natee with a knife during a company meeting. However, Natee chose not to press charges. Additionally, two suspects claim that Waree had several arguments with Natee on the day of the incident, and one of them alleges that Waree threatened to kill Natee.
At the time of the incident, she was living in a third-floor bedroom in Natee's house. She claims she took a prescription sleeping pill and went to sleep at approximately 6 PM, waking up at 8 AM the next morning. She stated that she heard no sounds during that time, which she claims is normal after taking her medication.

He is highly accomplished both academically and professionally, having won over 100 awards at national and international levels. Together with his younger brother, he rescued the CLM Group from near bankruptcy, transforming it into a renowned company in Southeast Asia. Despite his success, he has never been publicly linked to any romantic relationships.
Currently, Natee works in the office three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. On Tuesdays and Fridays, his secretary, Terra, brings documents to his home so he can work remotely. On the day of the incident, he was working from home, and Terra delivered documents for him to sign. Additionally, several suspects came to meet with him to discuss important matters.
Before his death, Natee attended an evening seminar, returning home at 8:45 PM. Everything appeared normal during the seminar, but what happened after is unknown. His body was found with a knife in his left chest. The room had been ransacked, with personal belongings scattered everywhere and some valuables missing. There were bloodstains near his body. The crime scene was unintentionally compromised by the person who discovered his body.

In a past interview on a famous TV show, Samut mentioned that Tara aspired to be a nature conservationist, which led him to try and stay out of the CLM Group's business.
However, during the CLM Property crisis, he and Natee stepped in to manage the company while still in university. Together, they successfully rescued the business from the brink of collapse. Afterward, Tara withdrew, leaving Natee to continue assisting Samut with management.
Tara received grants to study and work in several countries, including South Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Australia, and Germany. He is a polyglot, fluent in many languages, including Thai, English, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and German. He once made headlines in Thailand for rescuing an elephant stuck in mud and, in Vietnam, for saving a blue whale that was stranded on a beach.
Three years ago, Tara was in a car accident. He had driven from home to buy groceries when his car skidded off the road and plunged into a river. His death became a major news story in Thailand for a time.

Ray lives a quiet, solitary life, filling his time with anime and manga. But a witness claims they saw him in a heated argument with Natee on the morning of the murder. 

At the time of the incident, he claims he was at home watching anime when Jenny arrived for a work meeting. He says he went back to watching anime until he fell asleep after she left. `

She currently lives in Natee’s house and spends her free time reading, listening to music, cooking, and gardening. However, multiple witnesses confirm she often spends her days off with Hoang, but no one knows where they go or what they do. On the day of the murder, some witnesses also saw her and Hoang at Natee's house during the daytime. 

At the time of the incident, she claims she went to the ABC shopping mall to buy groceries and couldn't find a ride home, so she called Hoang to pick her up. When they returned, they found the house ransacked and Natee stabbed to death in his office.
